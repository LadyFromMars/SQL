Task:
 It's your first day as a TechCrunch reporter. Your first task is to write an article on the rising trends in the startup world.

To get you started with your research, your boss emailed you a project.sqlite file that contains a table called startups. It is a portfolio of some of the biggest names in the industry.

Write queries with aggregate functions to retrieve some interesting insights about these companies.



2. Calculate the total number of companies in the table.

SELECT COUNT(name)
FROM startups;


3. We want to know the total value of all companies in this table.

SELECT SUM(valuation)
FROM startups;


4. What is the highest amount raised by a startup?

SELECT MAX(raised)
FROM startups;


5. Edit the query so that it returns the maximum amount of money raised, during 'Seed' stage.

SELECT MAX(raised)
FROM startups
WHERE stage = 'Seed';


6. What year is the oldest company on the list founded on?

SELECT MIN(founded)
FROM startups;


7. Return the average valuation

SELECT AVG(valuation)
FROM startups;

8-10. Return the average valuation, in each category.
Round the averages to two decimal places,
order the list from highest averages to lowest.

SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY 2 DESC;


11-12.  What are the most competitive markets?
First, return the name of each category with the total number of companies that belong to it.
Next, filter the result to only include categories that have more than three companies in them.

SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT (*) >3 ;



13-14. What is the average size of a startup in each location? with average sizes above 500?

SELECT location, AVG(employees)
FROM startups
GROUP BY location
HAVING AVG(employees) > 500;
